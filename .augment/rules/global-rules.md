## Git

1. After every code changes, write a suitable git commit message according to git conventional commits.
2. Use `git mv` for moving tracked files and `git rm` for removing tracked files

### auto commit

Atomic Commit is your utmost priority. You should commit each changes after logical step before continuing your task. HOWEVER, you should first evaluate and plan thoroughly how to structure the "logical groups" of the commits. Sometimes, if the changes aren't too large, it may be fine to combined them all into one 1 commit, assuming there is no conflicting logical meaning
